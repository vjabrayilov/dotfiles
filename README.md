- `ys{motion}{char}`, which surrounds a given |motion| or |text-object| with a
delimiter pair associated with {char}. For example, `ysa")` means "you surround
around quotes with parentheses".

- There are insert-mode *<C-g>s* and visual-mode *S* mappings, that
add the delimiter pair around the cursor and visual selection, respectively.

- To delete a delimiter pair, use the *ds* operator, which stands for "delete
surround". It is used via `ds[char]`.

- To change a delimiter pair, use the *cs* operator, which stands for "change
surround". It is used via `cs{target}{replacement}`, changing the surrounding
pair associated with {target} to a pair associated with {replacement}.
